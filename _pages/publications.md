### Efficient Point Cloud Indexing
Advisor: Prof. Xiaofang ZHOU - Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HK  
- Discrete spatial-temporal data is not easy to handle because of some challenging properties, such as multi-
dimensionality and large-scale.
- We aim to design and implement an integrated point cloud index by leveraging the original index method as a
foundation. Our ultimate objective is to realize the design of a database index system that supports time queries
while ensuring stable and efficient query performance.
- Owing to the unbalanced structure of the existing method, the time cost for queries becomes unstable and varies
with different data distributions. The initial solution proposed by the project is to employ a balanced search tree.

### Generative Graph Embedding Inversion Attack
Advisor: Dr. Yangqiu Song - Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HK
- With the increasing availability of embedding vector databases, the potential for recovering the original data from
embeddings has emerged as a critical privacy concern. When data owners send embeddings to a third party that
is not entirely trusted, there is a risk of the third party potentially victimizing the embeddings through inversion
techniques to reconstruct the original data.
- Under an iterative method of generative inversion, employing a generative model for the reconstruction of original
data has proven to be effective. We propose a novel architecture that utilizes an iterative method to reconstruct
both node and relation information. The iterative mechanism aids in reinforcing and refining the recovery results
at each iteration, leading to improved accuracy.
