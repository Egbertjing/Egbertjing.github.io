As a final-year undergraduate student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), pursuing a main major in Data Science and Technology and a minor in Mathematics. Currently, I am working with [Haoran Li](https://hlibt.student.ust.hk/) on embedding inversion attack, advised by Prof. [Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/) on [KnowComp Group](https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp). 

Research Interest
======
My research interests encompass a wide range of machine learning applications, focusing specifically on natural language processing, large language models, and addressing privacy concerns in the field of machine learning. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have dedicated my focus to addressing privacy concerns in machine learning and training problem on knowledge graph. My ultimate goal is to identify and address security issues across the entire pipeline of machine learning.
