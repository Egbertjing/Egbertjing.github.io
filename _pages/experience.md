### Efficient Point Cloud Indexing
Advisor: Prof. Xiaofang ZHOU - Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HK  
- Discrete spatial-temporal data is not easy to handle because of some challenging properties, such as multi-
dimensionality and large-scale.
- We aim to design and implement an integrated point cloud index by leveraging the original index method as a
foundation. Our ultimate objective is to realize the design of a database index system that supports time queries
while ensuring stable and efficient query performance.
- Owing to the unbalanced structure of the existing method, the time cost for queries becomes unstable and varies
with different data distributions. The initial solution proposed by the project is to employ a balanced search tree.
